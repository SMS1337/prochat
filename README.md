# Description
ProChat is a semi-lightweight chat client meant to help ease the efforts and encourage customizability to users where the core chat can't. This is the open-source repositry where anyone (yes, anyone.) can work together on this. Updates sent to the model are usually weekly if not important.

# Error reporting
Although you can report errors to developers or fix it yourself, it's best to first document it in the [errors](https://github.com/dylanROBLOX/prochat/issues) tab first. Helps keep track and organized.

# Compiling
"XML files??? What's that!!!!!????" XML files can be read by ROBLOX Studio, it's what makes up places. You can import the XML files by renaming them to "RBXMX" extensions.
